# syncItunes2Mtp
Tool to synchronize an iTunes music library (music, playlist, other) with an MTP device and guidelines for day to day scenarios.
(In fact, it can synchronize with any available mount point)

## Why such another tool ?
1. Handle music and audiobooks (or podcasts,...) separately (easy random on all music)
2. Update playlists when they change (Annoying bug in SonyBridge software for instance)
3. Avoid activating 'usb debugging' for syncing an android device

## Target scenario
1. MacOS with iTunes
  1.1 All music stored in Itunes media folder (iTunes Media/Music)
  1.1 All other audio files stored somewhere else
2. Android device
  2.1 Compatible with MortPlay music player (to be installed)
  2.2 Compatible with VLC or another directory based audio player (for audiobooks)
  
## My config
* MacbookAir 11', macOS high Sierra
* Fairphone 2, Android 6
* USB cable
